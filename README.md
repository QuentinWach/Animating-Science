**Learn to animate the ideas behind the science, and how to display data and simulations using the free tools of the Scipy stack.**

In the bachelor studies already one finds problems that may very well be solvable mathematically, yet are quite tough to imagine. Other times it is in fact not possible to find analytical solutions and so we have to settle for numerical methods. The computer can help us with the boring calculations and show what we could barely imagine before, if at all. Here you find a collection of diverse scripts simulating and animating science, some very basic, laying out the foundations of plotting and animating, other more focusing on certain numerical methods.
